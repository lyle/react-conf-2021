# React Conf 2021 Talk

This repo was created to share source code for my (Lyle) December 8th 2021 React Conf lighting talk.

Here are some of the things I referred to in the talk:

The [photos I used](https://photos.app.goo.gl/ZpD3N3tThVL7ocodA) to show off different workshops and art studios were taken by me, of either my workshop, and workshops/studios I have visited, mostly while enjoying the [Santa Cruz Open Studios Art Tour](https://santacruzopenstudios.com/) which happens every year in October.

I also found, but did not use, this amazing short film [Isolation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7_foJZk9zA) which shows a lot of different art studios.
